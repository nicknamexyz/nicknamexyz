7.	Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to:
a)	Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b)	Compute total number of members of club
c)	Display members
d)	Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

Theory 
A singly linked list is a dynamic data structure that allows efficient insertion and 
deletion of elements. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node, 
enabling traversal. This program uses linked lists to manage club membership, 
ensuring flexibility in managing members. 
 
Algorithm 
1. Define a Node class for storing PRN and Name. 
2. Define a Club class to manage the linked list operations: 
   a. Implement functions to add members at the beginning, end, and after a specific 
node. 
   b. Implement functions to delete members from the beginning, end, or by value. 
   c. Implement a function to compute the total number of members. 
   d. Implement a function to display members. 
   e. Implement a function to concatenate two lists. 
3. Implement the main function to interact with the user and manage the club 
members.
